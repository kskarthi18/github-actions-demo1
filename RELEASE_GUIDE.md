# GitHub Actions Release Guide

This repository contains GitHub Actions workflows to automatically build and release your DemoWebsite component.

## 🚀 Workflows

### 1. CI Build (`ci.yaml`)
- **Triggers**: On pushes to `main`/`develop` branches and pull requests
- **Purpose**: Validates builds and runs tests on every change
- **Outputs**: Build validation artifacts (for PRs)

### 2. Build and Release (`release.yaml`)
- **Triggers**: 
  - Automatically on version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v2.1.3`)
  - Manually via GitHub Actions UI
- **Purpose**: Creates official releases with deployment packages
- **Outputs**: 
  - GitHub Release with changelog
  - ZIP and TAR.GZ deployment packages
  - Build artifacts

## 📋 How to Create a Release

### Method 1: Automatic Release (Recommended)

1. **Create and push a version tag**:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **The workflow will automatically**:
   - Build the application
   - Run tests (if any exist)
   - Create deployment packages
   - Generate a changelog from git commits
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Upload release assets

### Method 2: Manual Release

1. **Go to GitHub Actions tab** in your repository
2. **Select "Build and Release" workflow**
3. **Click "Run workflow"**
4. **Enter the version** (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
5. **Click "Run workflow"**

## 📦 Release Assets

Each release includes:

- **DemoWebsite-vX.X.X.zip** - Windows/Cross-platform deployment package
- **DemoWebsite-vX.X.X.tar.gz** - Linux/Unix deployment package
- **Automated changelog** based on git commits since last release
- **Release notes** automatically generated by GitHub

## 🏷️ Version Tags

Use semantic versioning for your tags:

- **Major version**: `v2.0.0` (breaking changes)
- **Minor version**: `v1.1.0` (new features, backward compatible)
- **Patch version**: `v1.0.1` (bug fixes)
- **Pre-release**: `v1.0.0-alpha.1`, `v1.0.0-beta.1`, `v1.0.0-rc.1`

## 🔧 Customization

### Environment Variables
You can customize the workflow by modifying these variables in `.github/workflows/release.yaml`:

```yaml
env:
  DOTNET_VERSION: '8.0.x'        # .NET version to use
  PROJECT_PATH: './DemoWebsite'   # Path to your project
  ARTIFACT_NAME: 'DemoWebsite'   # Name for release artifacts
```

### Adding Tests
If you add test projects to your solution, the workflow will automatically:
- Detect test projects (projects ending in `.Tests.csproj` or containing `Test` in the name)
- Run tests during the build process
- Include test results in the workflow

### Custom Deployment
The workflow includes a `deploy` job that runs after successful releases. You can customize this to:
- Deploy to Azure App Service
- Deploy to AWS
- Deploy to your own servers
- Update container registries
- Send notifications

## 🛡️ Security

- The workflows use **GitHub's built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`** for creating releases
- No additional secrets are required for basic functionality
- For custom deployments, add secrets in **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**

## 📈 Monitoring

- **View workflow runs** in the Actions tab
- **Download artifacts** from completed runs
- **Monitor build status** with GitHub's status checks
- **Get notifications** for failed builds (configurable in GitHub settings)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Workflow doesn't trigger on tag**:
   - Ensure the tag follows the pattern `v*.*.*`
   - Check that the tag was pushed: `git push origin --tags`

2. **Build fails**:
   - Check the project path in `PROJECT_PATH` environment variable
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly configured
   - Review the workflow logs in the Actions tab

3. **Release creation fails**:
   - Verify repository permissions
   - Check that `GITHUB_TOKEN` has necessary permissions

### Getting Help:
- Check the workflow logs in the GitHub Actions tab
- Review the error messages in failed steps
- Ensure your project structure matches the workflow expectations

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Use semantic versioning** for consistent releases
2. **Write meaningful commit messages** (they become part of the changelog)
3. **Test locally** before creating releases
4. **Use pre-release tags** (`alpha`, `beta`, `rc`) for testing
5. **Review generated releases** before announcing to users
